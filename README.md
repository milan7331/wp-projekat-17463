# WebStore 17463
This is a simple web store demo, it was created for one of my university courses using a combination of `HTML + CSS + JavaScript ES6`.
A basic CRUD `.NET 5 Web API` was used as the backend.

## The welcome page
Used as a simple greeting page with a quick description featuring a navbar for quick access.
